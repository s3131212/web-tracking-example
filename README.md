# Web Tracking Example

This repo contains some examples of how to track users on the web. The content is roughly divided into two sections: stateful tracking and browser fingerprinting (i.e., stateless tracking).  

These implementations are for educational purposes only. It is (quite obviously) not intended for production use.
Some of the content is derived from open source implementations. The original licenses apply. Check comments in the code for more details.  

The more detailed description is a work in progress, if I ever find the time and motivation to finish it.  

Also check out my [notes](https://web-tracking.allenchou.cc/) (in traditional Chinese) if you are interested. It's poorly written and probably full of errors, but it's a good place to start if you want to learn more about web tracking.
